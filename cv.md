## About myself:


*After graduating from the Academy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Belarus in 2016, I received the specialty "Forensic Expertise" and in July of the same year I started working in the specialty I received. After working as a senior expert for 5 years, he quit his job and decided to radically change his life. For this reason, I began to study programming and in particular front-end development. During my studies and work, I became interested in photography and video shooting, learned Photoshop and some video editors. At present, I would like to get a truly sought-after specialty in the labor market and enjoy work. I believe that my perseverance will help me become a good developer.*
